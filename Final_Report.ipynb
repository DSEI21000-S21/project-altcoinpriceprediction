    "With cryptocurrency interest on the rise, there are many investment (short-term or long-term) opportunities to be had, especially due to the volatility of certain digital assets. The cryptocurrency market is tough to predict, just as the stock market, so we aim to create simple and complex models which are capable of forecasting low-cap coins and altcoins, which are generally subject to larger price swings. Using these models, the ultimate goal is to profit through trading these assets. We do this using autoregression, MACD and Bollinger Bands, and LSTM models. We test on historical price data of many different cryptocurrencies, and forecast using more recent data gathered from CoinAPI."
