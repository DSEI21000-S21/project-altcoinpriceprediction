    "A cryptocurrency (or “crypto”) is a digital currency that can be used to buy goods and services, but uses an online ledger with strong cryptography which exists in the a form of computerized database, to secure online transactions. \\Securing online transactions is important, and this is done by controlling the creation of additional coins, and verifying the transfer of coin ownership."

    "According to Jan Lansky, a cryptocurrency is a system that meets six conditions:\n",
    "1. Does not require a central authority - its state is maintained through distributed consensus\n",
    "2. Keeps an overview of cryptocurrency units and their ownership\n",
    "3. Defines whether new cryptocurrency units can be created. If new cryptocurrency units can be created, the system defines the circumstances of their origin and how to determine the ownership of these new units\n",
    "4. Ownership of cryptocurrency units can be proved exclusively cryptographically.\n",
    "5. Allows transactions to be performed in which ownership of the cryptographic units is changed. A transaction statement can only be issued by an entity proving the current ownership of these units.\n",
    "6. If two different instructions for changing the ownership of the same cryptographic units are simultaneously entered, the system performs at most one of them"
